4. reminds of a combination of "beatsch and bas", feels like something theyve tired before but electronic

6. Fun
8. Cool, a little bit difficult to see how to use it.
9. Interesting, diffrent in that is a computer making sounds and not ones own force
10. Invisible strings makes sense after being hinted, a bit difficult to understand but after that quite easy to use, also cool
11. Fun cool, interesting how it simmilar but still diffrent to clasical instruments, and inovative (Take a quote from here)
